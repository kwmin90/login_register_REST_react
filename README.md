# login_register_REST_react

Recreated my previous Angular project using following technologies:

-React
-redux
-Node.js
-JSON Web Token
-Express
-MongoDB

Implemented registration, login, form validation, protected route, and account view.

Email confirmation could easily have been implemented using Nodemailer, but decided against it for convenience.
